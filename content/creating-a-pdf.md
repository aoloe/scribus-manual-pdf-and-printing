# Creating a PDF

Scribus uses its own high quality PDF library.

The creation of a PDF file can be triggered through:

- File > Export > Save as Pdf
- The `ctrl-shift-p` keyboard shortcut
- The "PDF" button in the "File" toolbar

If Scribus finds possible errors in your document, it will list them in the "Preflight verifier".  
As soon as there are no potential issues left, you will get to the PDF dialog.

Scribus offers several options for fine tunining the PDF and match the print shop's expectations.
